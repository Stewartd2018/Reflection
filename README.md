This week we learned about how to code and learned more basic commands. We learned how to make folders inside of folders, and put files into that. We also started to learn how to put things on GitHub and post it on the website from putty.

This week we learned the absolute beginning of putty and how it is based on Linux. We connected to Mr.Gold's ubuntu server and learned the beginning of how putty works. We also talked about one way and two-way functions, and how 1-way encryption work. In a one way encryption, only one person has the key, but they give out the lock. In a two way encryption, anyone who is part of the chain can decipher the message sent. I also became more interested in how encryption works, so I chose to make my google Friday project on the enigma machine.

We learned multiple ways of encription, such as the ceaser cipher. The Caesar cipher moves letters up or down a certain number of letters to change the word so if I said "Hello," I would change it to "ifmmp." We started learning about modular arithmetic. We learned how some cryptography works, and we tried to make it so a specific person would be able to decrypt it, without and anyone else being able to, be that it would fail because the other person did not have the key to the encryption. The legend tells the other person how to decrypt the message you gave them,m and without it, that person, as well as nobody else knew how to decrypt it. Railroad encryption works like the word is put up in a zigzag way and that is how you decrypt it so "hi there" would be "htee ihr."

We discussed what IP Addresses are and how there are about 4 billion available and how they are used to find where you are. We also discussed how text messages first worked by using packets to send the location of other phones. Those packets were later used to send messages to other phones. We talked about how https means that you are on a secure network. We talked about bitcoin as well and how you can make a game online and use all of the other people's computers to help mine bitcoins. Moreover, finally, we discussed servers and how they are, basically, a computer that a computer runs on.
