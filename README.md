This week we went over CSS. We also started to learn how to bootstrap. We cannot bootstrap right now though because we do not know how to input it. We learned about divs and classes that help us make websites look more professional. We ended up using what we learned to make a website to order pizza.

This week we learned about HTML. We learned how HTML is a lot like XML. We also learned about how to put in pictures and bullet points into HTML. Through my own study, I learned about how to make radio buttons and submit buttons for my enigma machine. I am excited to learn more about how to make that enigma machine

This entire week we ended up working on our XML projects. We listed out over 90 animals and learned how to add atrributes using the alligators, quotations, etc.( <asdf asdf="asdf"></asdf>). We mostly worked on this all week. We listed over 90 individual animals and gave them all names and attributes. The XML project ended up being aroung 300 lines of XML code. I enjoyed it, but it was very tedious.

I was only partially here this week, but this week I learned how to work more in putty. I learned about how different things work, like being able to put my google classroom on github. I barely started to learn about XML formatting and how it works with sorting everything in the classroom. We are going to learn more about XML.

This week we learned the absolute beginning of putty and how it is based on Linux. We connected to Mr.Gold's ubuntu server and learned the beginning of how putty works. We also talked about one way and two-way functions, and how 1-way encryption work. In a one way encryption, only one person has the key, but they give out the lock. In a two way encryption, anyone who is part of the chain can decipher the message sent. I also became more interested in how encryption works, so I chose to make my google Friday project on the enigma machine.

We learned multiple ways of encription, such as the ceaser cipher. The Caesar cipher moves letters up or down a certain number of letters to change the word so if I said "Hello," I would change it to "ifmmp." We started learning about modular arithmetic. We learned how some cryptography works, and we tried to make it so a specific person would be able to decrypt it, without and anyone else being able to, be that it would fail because the other person did not have the key to the encryption. The legend tells the other person how to decrypt the message you gave them,m and without it, that person, as well as nobody else knew how to decrypt it. Railroad encryption works like the word is put up in a zigzag way and that is how you decrypt it so "hi there" would be "htee ihr."

We discussed what IP Addresses are and how there are about 4 billion available and how they are used to find where you are. We also discussed how text messages first worked by using packets to send the location of other phones. Those packets were later used to send messages to other phones. We talked about how https means that you are on a secure network. We talked about bitcoin as well and how you can make a game online and use all of the other people's computers to help mine bitcoins. Moreover, finally, we discussed servers and how they are, basically, a computer that a computer runs on.

This week was more a week of review for me. We discussed things that were talked about in computer fundamentals one such as binary and how to translate it into numbers and vice-versa. You make a chart with by the powers of 2 (1,2,4,8,16,32,etc.) and then whatever numbers it takes to add to the number you are trying to get to, you put a one under, and all the numbers that are not going to be used, you put a 0 under. We also had a quick discussion on ternary and how that works and how its similar to binary. We also have discussed the class syllabus and all the rules and regulations of the class.
